I was unable to implement working with numerical attributes, however symbolic attributes work. Reduction of the base rules (eliminating unnecessary conditions) is preformed in the reduceRules() function and the related functions. The functions that eliminate negation are eliminateNegation(), eliminateNegationRule(), and eliminateNegationHelper(). To compile the project, write 'make' into the command line for any cycle server, then type './project1' to call the project. You will be further prompted for the file you wish to have rules generated for, the result will be written to yourfile.with.negation and yourfile.without.negation. The algorithm assumes that the file you pass it has an extension with three characters. If the file extension is less than three characters, some of the name will be chopped off.
