### Abstract

Thank you so much for your interest in my school projects! I imagine you aren't interested
in looking through my entire five years of schoolwork, so if you are interested
in my most difficult/impressive project, head to EECS672Graphics SampleSet3
project 3 where I made a rubiks cube from scratch (with a lighting enviornment).

If you are more interested in data structures or C++ work, please look in
EECS 560 which contains work on various Heaps and simpler data structures
