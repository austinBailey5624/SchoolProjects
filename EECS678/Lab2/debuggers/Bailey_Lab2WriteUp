I thought the lab was informative but also the GTA moved a little slow. I have
also used gdb and valgrind before in 268 so it was a little repetitive. The
interaction with code to debug was well thought out and executed. Also the
GTA was perhaps too quiet, although I was sitting in the back row. I also
felt that to avoid the 'droning on' feeling it would be better to ask the
class questions to get feedback/interaction
