  <center><h2>Biography</h2></center>
  <hr><br/>

  <h4><p>I enjoy writing poetry and prose, practiced martial arts for eleven years, and am
    a member of the swing dance club at ku. I enjoy mathematics and computer science,
    am a vegetarian buddhist who jogs every day and goes boxing three times a week. I
    wish that employers would look at my github page instead of my resumae</p></h4>

    <center><h2>Favorite Websites</h2></center>
    <hr/><br/>
    <h4><p>My favorite website is a blog by a game designer that I've been following since
      I was 13 called: <a href="http://www.alorafane.com">Alora Fane</a><br/>
      His earlier website that has some great archived earlier games is called:
      <a href="http://www.fighunter.com">Fighunter</a><br>
      Perhaps my favorite game of all time that isn't even finished can be played
      (in its incomplete form) here: <a href= "http://www.fighunter.com/?page=game&g=BSGN">
      Beast Signer</a><br/>
      As a computer nerd, I of course live on this website:  <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a><br/>

    <p>Ajahn Brahm is a great spiritual teacher of mine, and I was first
      introduced to him by watching the following video:<br/><br/>
